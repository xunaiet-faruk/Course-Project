 2nd question : Discuss how you managed the state in your assignment project.

 Answer :  
 6 React concepts were taught and I used them when needed. First, I Created the Component,  then Created the Jsx file and Created the Component function there. Since I will work with fake Api data inside it, first I collected data using uesEffect and Since that data will be passed to another Component,  I Copied it with a uesstate declarer. Now I will check the Copied data whether it is object or array.  If it is an array then I will dynamically return the elements as props to another component.  I have sent it as props because I will receive it as props in that Component. Then by Destructuring those proposal props,  I can dynamically show them on the wave page in jsx. I am using total 5 usestates 1st to load data and show fake data 2nd to show names 3rd to manage time hours 4th to show all prices 5th to manage remaining I keep all the data in this state
